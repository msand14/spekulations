Get the last news from under 10$ Stocks in your email. Just in case you are to busy to search the news of interesting cheap Stocks, and you want to be aware of interesting headlines in the premarket ( for example) you can just launch this programm and there you go!


In order to get this work, its needed to install all the libraries contained in the requirements.txt file.
Then  configure the emails and password to get your email configuration done. After that just launch the main.py.
In case its required by the program a loggs/ directory, create a new directory with that name at the same level as modules and thats it
